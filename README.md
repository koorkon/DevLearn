# Project Summary

This project includes setting up both the frontend and backend foundations, including React and Spring Boot project structures, routing, database configuration, GitHub repository setup, and a basic Docker environment.

Core features developed so far include file upload functionality, AI-based summary generation, and storing processed data in the database. The frontend is integrated with backend APIs to fetch summaries, MCQs, and flashcards, while the backend supports MCQ and flashcard generation along with testing.

Additional work includes improving UI/UX, adding loading states and error handling, optimizing performance, securing APIs with validation and JWT/Spring Security, and enhancing backend/database efficiency. Ongoing efforts also cover documentation, responsive UI polishing, and preparing the project for deployment.
